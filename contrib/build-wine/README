These scripts can be used for cross-compilation of Windows Electrum-FJC executables from Linux/Wine.

Usage:
1. Install Wine (tested with wine1.8 on Ubuntu 16.04 x64)
2. Run "./prepare-wine.sh", it will download all dependencies. When you'll be asked, always leave default settings and press "Next >".
3. Run "./prepare-pip.sh", it will install required modules. 
4. Run "./prepare-hw.sh" to build support for hardware wallets (TREZOR)
5. Run "./build-electrum-git.sh". Sources will be packed into three separate versions to dist/ directory:
  * Standalone compressed executable is "dist/electrum.exe"
  * Uncompressed binaries are in "dist/electrum". They're useful for comparsion with other builds.
  * NSIS-based installer of Electrum is "electrum-setup.exe"
