These scripts can be used for cross-compilation of Windows Electrum executables from Linux/Wine.

Usage:
1. Install Wine (tested with wine-1.7.18)
2. Run "./prepare-wine.sh", it will download all dependencies. When you'll be asked, always leave default settings and press "Next >".
3. Run "./prepare-MSVCFP27.sh", it will install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 
4. Run "./prepare-hw.sh" to build support for hardware wallets (TREZOR)
5. Run "./build-electrum-git.sh". Sources will be packed into three separate versions to dist/ directory:
  * Standalone compressed executable is "dist/electrum.exe"
  * Uncompressed binaries are in "dist/electrum". They're useful for comparsion with other builds.
  * NSIS-based installer of Electrum is "electrum-setup.exe"
7. Everytime you want to rebuild new version of Electrum just change the path to ZIP file in "build-electrum.sh" and re-run the script.
